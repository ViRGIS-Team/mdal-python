Changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0.9.0

First release. This is beta software and has not been completely tested yet:

Currently, this integration can:

- read all MDAL compatible file formats,
- access the metadata for the source,
- access the vertex, face and edge data as numpy arrays,
- access 'double' datasets (both scalar and vector) as numpy arrays, and
- convert the MDAL source mesh into a `meshio`_ mesh object (with some restrictions currently).

This version does not currently allow the MDAL source mesh to be written or ammended.
